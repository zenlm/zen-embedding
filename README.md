## Introduction

**Zen Embedding** is a family of multilingual text embedding models from Zen LM by Hanzo AI. Available in three sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B), the 8B model ranks **#1 on the MTEB multilingual leaderboard** (score 70.58, as of June 2025).

These models support over 100 languages, 32K context, Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) for flexible vector dimensions, and instruction-aware embeddings for task-specific tuning.

## Model Family

| Model | Parameters | Embedding Dim | Context | MRL |

# Qwen3 Embedding

## Highlights

The Qwen3 Embedding model series is the latest proprietary model of the Qwen family, specifically designed for text embedding and ranking tasks. Building upon the dense foundational models of the Qwen3 series, it provides a comprehensive range of text embeddings and reranking models in various sizes (0.6B, 4B, and 8B). This series inherits the exceptional multilingual capabilities, long-text understanding, and reasoning skills of its foundational model. The Qwen3 Embedding series represents significant advancements in multiple text embedding and ranking tasks, including text retrieval, code retrieval, text classification, text clustering, and bitext mining.

**Exceptional Versatility**: The embedding model has achieved state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of downstream application evaluations. The 8B size embedding model ranks **No.1** in the MTEB multilingual leaderboard (as of June 5, 2025, score **70.58**), while the reranking model excels in various text retrieval scenarios.

**Comprehensive Flexibility**: The Qwen3 Embedding series offers a full spectrum of sizes (from 0.6B to 8B) for both embedding and reranking models, catering to diverse use cases that prioritize efficiency and effectiveness. Developers can seamlessly combine these two modules. Additionally, the embedding model allows for flexible vector definitions across all dimensions, and both embedding and reranking models support user-defined instructions to enhance performance for specific tasks, languages, or scenarios.

**Multilingual Capability**: The Qwen3 Embedding series offer support for over 100 languages, thanks to the multilingual capabilities of Qwen3 models. This includes various programming languages, and provides robust multilingual, cross-lingual, and code retrieval capabilities.

> **Note**:
> - `MRL (Matryoshka Representation Learning) Support` indicates whether the embedding model supports custom dimensions for the final embedding. 
> - `Instruction Aware` notes whether the embedding or reranking model supports customizing the input instruction according to different tasks.
> - Our evaluation indicates that, for most downstream tasks, using instructions (instruct) typically yields an improvement of 1% to 5% compared to not using them. Therefore, we recommend that developers create tailored instructions specific to their tasks and scenarios. In multilingual contexts, we also advise users to write their instructions in English, as most instructions utilized during the model training process were originally written in English.

print(scores.tolist())
```

### Sentence Transformers Usage

```python
# Requires sentence-transformers>=2.7.0
import torch
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer("zenlm/zen-embedding-8b")

queries = ["What is the capital of France?", "Explain gradient descent"]
documents = [
    "Paris is the capital of France.",
    "Gradient descent minimizes a loss function by following the negative gradient.",
]

with torch.no_grad():
    query_embeddings = model.encode(queries, prompt_name="query")
    document_embeddings = model.encode(documents)

similarity = model.similarity(query_embeddings, document_embeddings)
print(similarity)
```

## Instruction Guidance

For best results, write task-specific instructions in English even when working with other languages. Examples:

```python
# Retrieval
task = 'Given a web search query, retrieve relevant passages that answer the query'

# Classification
task = 'Classify the sentiment of the following text'

# Clustering
task = 'Identify the topic of the following document'

# Code retrieval
task = 'Given a code comment, retrieve the code implementation that matches'
```

Instructions improve performance by 1-5% on most retrieval tasks. Do not apply instructions to retrieval documents — only to queries.

## Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL)

All Zen Embedding models support MRL: you can truncate embeddings to smaller dimensions without retraining.

```python
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Full dimension (8B model: 4096)
full_embeddings = F.normalize(embeddings, p=2, dim=1)

# Truncate to 1024 dimensions for storage efficiency
truncated = F.normalize(embeddings[:, :1024], p=2, dim=1)
```

📌 **Tip**: We recommend that developers customize the `instruct` according to their specific scenarios, tasks, and languages. Our tests have shown that in most retrieval scenarios, not using an `instruct` on the query side can lead to a drop in retrieval performance by approximately 1% to 5%.

For more usage examples, see the code in the [examples]() sections.

## Training

The code and instructions for training Qwen3-Embedding models can be found in the [training docs](docs/training).

## Evaluation

The code for reproducing the following results is available in the [evaluation]() section.
